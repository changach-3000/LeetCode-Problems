# LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of LeetCode problems that I have solved as part of my coding journey. These problems cover various data structures and algorithms topics and can be helpful for both learning and revising coding concepts.

## Problem Categories

I have decided to challenge myself with the top 150 interview questions.



## Problem Solutions

Each problem directory includes:

- A well-documented solution in a javasript and or ruby.
- A clear explanation of the problem statement and approach used to solve it.

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference for your LeetCode practice. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Happy Coding!

I hope you find this repository helpful in your LeetCode practice. Remember, the more you practice, the better you become at problem-solving and coding. Happy coding!
